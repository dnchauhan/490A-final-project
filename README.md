# 490A-final-project

Classify different types of restaurant reviews extracted from the YELP dataset (https://www.yelp.com/dataset/documentation/main).

Investigate ambiguous reviews that have sentiments on both ends of the spectrum and how our model classifies them to figure out potential ways to improve the model performance.
Example: “I loved the ambiance of the restaurant; however, the food was absolutely terrible.”
